# DS-Unit03
Repo for Unit 03

PIPFILE - general packages, all quite standard - most notable is Pydataset - 
this allows us to import some toy dataframes such as titanic in order to test out our functions / methods. 


helper_functions.py :
these are functions that I have been working on to clean a dataframe or establish things such as null counts, cardinality as a percentage of dataframe etc. 

test_helper_functions.py:
these are tests (pytest in this case) checking my functions out. They are a work in progress as I progress through this unit. 

OOP_examples: 
this file is examples of object oriented programming, creating classes, creating methods within classes, etc. functionally, this forms the foundation of many of the other files. 

Wallet.py:
a simple exercise from class about adding balances / doing simple math using methods inside of a package. 

code_review.py: 
this is an example of attempting to conform code to the pep8 standard. 

helper_functions_orig:
these are some of the examples from our guided project around the same concepts of classes and methods etc. 

*** Stay tuned for updates, this is a draft / student repo anyways.
